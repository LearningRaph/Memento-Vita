# Memento-Vita
An easily adaptable data viz to put things in perspective and enjoy every moment in life.

Inspired by the Memento Mori moto, this data viz is supposed to help take a step back and watch time flowing. Not to end up with bad feelings, I added an option to also show events that are important and represent an achievment in the time already spent living like happy encounters, great jobs or travels.

## Configuration
You just have to edit the data file with the birth and presumed death and add some events. For the period of the events, you have three options : have multiple begin and end dates (eg. if you go often in a foreign country), use the same begin and end date (eg. to mark the date you met someone), use the end date as "now" (eg. for an ongoing job).
