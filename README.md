# Memento-Vita
An easily adaptable data viz inspired by the Memento Mori moto to put things in perspective and enjoy every moment in life.

Each square represents a week of your life. Darker ones are past weeks while lighter ones are furture weeks. Not to end up with bad feelings, I added an option to also show events that are important in your life like happy encounters, great jobs or memorable travels.


## Configuration
Create a data file for each person with the birth and presumed death and add some events. For the period of the events, you have three options : 
- have multiple begin and end dates (eg. if you go often in a foreign country), 
- use the same begin and end date (eg. to mark the date you met someone), 
- use the end date as "now" (eg. for an ongoing job).
